module BankPayments::SwedbankExport

  # An export file may contain multiple sequences. A sequence starts with an
  # {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::OpeningRecord} and ends with an
  # {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::ReconciliationRecord}. Each sequence will
  # consist of at least the following:
  #
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::OpeningRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::NameRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::AddressRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::BankRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::MoneyRecord} (Payment or Credit Memo)
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::ReasonRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::ReconciliationRecord}
  #
  # In particular you need to supply the following per beneficiary/payee:
  #
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::NameRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::AddressRecord}
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::BankRecord}
  #
  # which describes where the payment should be made. Then you will supply
  # a money record (payment or credit memo) together with it reason to to
  # describe a payment. All of these records will have a unique serial number
  # for the beneficiary.
  #
  # According to the documentation you can group money records together with the
  # beneficiary given that the have the correct serial number.
  #
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::MoneyRecord} (Payment or Credit Memo)
  # * {BankPayments::SwedbankExport::ReasonRecord}
